It does not matter how did we get to that moment, but we are in a position where we must resolve a personal matter or make a decision. That only it concerns us.

If we choose to ask for advice, we are losing the opportunity to develop our self-sufficiency.

Before looking abroad, handle the situation by yourself. It is worth noting the benefits:

* More control and responsibility for your decisions.
* Fend for yourself.
* Change our perception of loneliness. This is not bad. It is the best way to know yourself, respect yourself and have a good self-esteem.
* Take your own decisions. Grant yourself the right to fail and accept the consequences.
